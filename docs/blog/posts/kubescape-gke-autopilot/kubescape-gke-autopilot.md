# Kubescape Node Agent Now Works on GKE Autopilot Clusters

The Kubescape community is excited to share that **Kubescapeâ€™s node agent now supports GKE Autopilot clusters**, thanks to Google Cloudâ€™s newly introduced **Workload Allowlisting** capability.

This is a significant milestone that opens the door for **full runtime observability and Kubernetes-native security** on fully-managed GKE environments.

---

## A Quick Background: Why It Wasnâ€™t Possible Before

Historically, GKE Autopilot enforced strict constraints on workloads requiring privileged permissions, like those needed by Kubescapeâ€™s node agent. This made it impossible to get visibility into system-level activity â€” something many security-conscious users rely on for runtime protection, vulnerability tracing, and compliance enforcement.

But with the rollout of Google Cloudâ€™s **Autopilot partner workload support**, this has changed. Users can now explicitly allow trusted workloads through a declarative **AllowlistSynchronizer** configuration. Kubescape is among the first open-source tools to make use of this capability.

## Why It Matters

By running Kubescapeâ€™s node agent on GKE Autopilot, users can finally get **deep runtime visibility and Kubernetes-native security** without needing to manage the underlying nodes themselves.

This means:

* Access to **real-time anomaly detection** from inside your container and host environment
* Support for **seccomp and network policy insights**, including smart suggestions
* Seamless **vulnerability prioritization** with in-use and reachable package analysis
* **Compliance scanning and misconfiguration detection** with behavioral remediation insights

## How to Enable It

1. Make sure your cluster is running GKE Autopilot **version `1.32.2-gke.1652000` or newer**
2. Use Kubescape Helm chart **version `1.27.5` or newer**
3. Create an `AllowlistSynchronizer` object to sync the allowlist for Kubescape:

```yaml
apiVersion: auto.gke.io/v1
kind: AllowlistSynchronizer
metadata:
  name: kubescape-allow-list
spec:
  allowlistPaths:
  - ARMO/armo-kubescape-node-agent/1.27/*
```

4. Apply it to your cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f kubescape-allowlist.yaml
```

5. Confirm it's synced:

```bash
kubectl get WorkloadAllowlist
```

6. Install Kubescape with Helm:

```bash
helm upgrade --install kubescape kubescape/kubescape-operator \
  --set nodeAgent.gke.allowlist.enabled=true \
  --set nodeAgent.gke.allowlist.name=armo-kubescape-node-agent-1.27
```

7. Verify the node agent is running:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kubescape
```

## Whatâ€™s Next?

Kubescape continues to evolve with community input and contributions. Supporting GKE Autopilot is part of a broader goal: making **Kubernetes security accessible, powerful, and fully open** â€” no matter where or how you run your workloads. We're excited to see this feature land and look forward to seeing what the community will build with it.
