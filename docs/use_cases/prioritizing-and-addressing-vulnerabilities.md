#### **Scenario**

A development team, using Kubescape 3.0, discovers various vulnerabilities across their Kubernetes resources, including those within container images. To effectively prioritize and remediate these issues, they seek a systematic approach that factors in the immediate risk and strategic impact of each finding.

#### Example
Scanning nginx:1.24 image using Kubescape

## **Steps to Prioritize and Fix Vulnerabilities**


### Severity Assessment:

Use Kubescape 3.0 to scan and review the list of identified vulnerabilities, taking note of the severity ratings (Critical, High, Medium, Low) to gauge potential impacts.


### Availability of Fixes and Image Scanning:

Consider the "fixed in version" information for prompt updates to affected components, and utilize Kubescape’s image scanning capabilities to ensure container security.


### Fix Planning:

Prioritize fixes starting with the most critical vulnerabilities, considering both severity and real-world applicability as determined by the eBPF analysis (i.e. Images with CVEs that are loaded into memory). Integrate these fixes into your development workflow, working according to contextualized risk.


### Contextual Relevance with eBPF:

Utilize Kubescape’s helm chart, which leverages eBPF technology, to ascertain the actual relevance of vulnerabilities by identifying which packages are loaded into memory, providing a more accurate risk assessment.


### Testing and Deployment:

After implementing fixes, conduct comprehensive testing to prevent new issues. Deploy these updates in line with your organization’s protocols, ensuring stability and security.

Documentation:

Maintain detailed records of vulnerabilities, assessment methods, fix prioritization, and remediation actions to support accountability and compliance.


## **Addressing Unfixable Vulnerabilities**


### Risk Analysis:

Engage in a thorough risk analysis for vulnerabilities lacking immediate fixes, understanding the threat landscape and exposure level.


### Compensating Controls:

Deploy compensating controls such as network segmentation, seccomp profiles or stricter access regulations to mitigate risks, especially for vulnerabilities that are actively loaded into memory, as indicated by eBPF insights.


### Architectural Redesign:

Evaluate and plan for long-term architectural or design adjustments to remove or reduce the vulnerability’s footprint.


### Exception Policy:

If necessary, create an exception policy for unresolvable vulnerabilities that outlines mitigation actions, justifications, and a review timeline.

Enhanced Monitoring and Incident Preparedness:

Intensify surveillance on affected components and refine incident response plans to include strategies for potential exploit scenarios.
