In the evolving landscape of DevSecOps, the integration of security into the development lifecycle is paramount, especially for companies managing sensitive data and requiring robust compliance. Hereâ€™s a use case illustrating how a financial technology company employs Kubescape 3.0 to secure their Kubernetes development clusters.


---


#### **Scenario**

The DevOps team at an innovative fintech company is gearing up to deploy a new blockchain-based payment application to their Kubernetes development cluster. Understanding the sensitivity of their application, they need to ensure the highest security standards are met to protect against potential breaches and compliance slip-ups.


## Actions



1. Kubernetes Configuration Assessment:
    * The development team leverages Kubescape 3.0 to perform a thorough assessment of their Kubernetes manifest files.
    * Kubescape is integrated directly within their IDEs, such as Visual Studio Code, which enables real-time scanning and feedback during the development process.
2. Security Standards Enforcement:
    * The team selects a suite of security standards for Kubescape to enforce. This includes the CIS Benchmarks and the NSA/CISA guidance, alongside custom organizational policies specifically designed for the financial sector.
3. Vulnerability and Misconfiguration Reporting:
    * Once the assessment is complete, Kubescape generates a comprehensive report listing vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and suggestions for fixed versions.
    * The developers review these findings directly in their development environment, prioritizing issues based on severity.
4. Remediation and Iteration:
    * The team addresses the identified security gaps by modifying their Kubernetes configuration files.
    * They re-run Kubescape to ensure their remediation measures align with the security standards, and no new issues have surfaced.
5. CI Integration:
    * Kubescape scans are integrated into the continuous integration workflow, ensuring that each pull request or merge is scrutinized for security before being applied to the development cluster.
6. Security Baseline Establishment:
    * With the cluster configuration secured, this state is documented as a security baseline, providing a reference point for all future development activities.


## **Expected Outcome**



* Developers receive instantaneous security feedback as they code, drastically reducing the chances of vulnerabilities progressing through the development pipeline.
* Kubernetes manifests are under continuous assessment against rigorous security standards, thwarting the progression of insecure configurations.
* The development cluster remains shielded against security risks, with automated scanning serving as a checkpoint against configuration drift.


### **Additional Benefits**



* The preemptive scanning of configurations prior to deployment slashes the risk of introducing insecure workloads into the cluster.
* The prompt identification and correction of security issues ensure the development cycle remains swift yet secure.
* A proactive security ethos is cultivated, with security considerations embedded within daily workflows, eliminating the last-minute rush to patch up security holes.

Through the application of Kubescape 3.0, the fintech company ensures their Kubernetes clusters are not just operational fortresses but also bastions of security, aligning with the financial industry's stringent requirements for data protection and system integrity. The combination of early-stage scanning and continuous integration checks transforms security from a potential development bottleneck into a seamless part of the development lifecycle, fortifying their infrastructure and paving the way for secure innovation in the financial sector.
