#### **Scenario**

How can Kubescape be integrated into ArgoCD workflows to ensure that every Kubernetes deployment is secure, compliant with industry benchmarks, and automatically prevents the delivery of non-compliant deployments?


## **Actions**


### Kubescape Integration in ArgoCD Workflows:

Kubescape is woven into the ArgoCD deployment process, with its scans initiated through adding additional steps in the Application resource definition.

Kubescape examines Kubernetes manifests and Docker images, identifying both misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.


### Implementing Pre-Sync and Sync Hooks:

ArgoCD pre-sync hooks are set up to initiate Kubescape scans prior to the sync process, acting as an initial checkpoint.

Sync hooks invoke Kubescape as a last check, ensuring no security issues are introduced during the pipeline's execution.


### Policy Enforcement with Kubescape:

The team curates a selection of scan policies for Kubescape, adopting standards like CIS Benchmarks, NIST guidelines, or tailored organizational security protocols.


### Deployment Interruption on Detection of Risks:

Deployments are configured to be halted upon discovery of any critical issues by Kubescape, preventing progression of non-compliant changes.


### Security Issue Review and Resolution:

If Kubescape's scans blocks a deployment, the team examines the scan reports to pinpoint and resolve security concerns, guided by Kubescapeâ€™s remediation advice.


### Policy and Threshold Optimization:

Kubescape's policy settings and thresholds for failing a build are adjusted to align with the team's security objectives and delivery expectations.


## **Expected Outcome**


### Incorporating Kubescape within ArgoCD yields:

Automatic and comprehensive security assessments during deployments.

Assurance that only vetted, secure, and compliant applications are deployed.

Build-time detection of potential security risks, facilitating prompt resolution.

Mitigation of the likelihood of deploying insecure code, which enhances the organization's defense against security infractions and regulatory non-compliance.


## **Additional Benefits**

Instills a preemptive security approach by embedding checks early in the CI/CD process.

Nurtures a culture of security awareness with immediate developer feedback on security lapses.

Ensures a streamlined adherence to set security standards and regulatory requirements.
