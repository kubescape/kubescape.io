_Open-source Kubernetes Security: Practical, End-to-End Coverage_

Kubescape is an open-source Kubernetes security platform designed to provide practical, end-to-end security for Kubernetes environments. It supports engineers and operators throughout the development and deployment lifecycle, offering tools for configuration scanning, vulnerability assessment, policy enforcement, network policy and seccomp validation, and runtime threat detection.

_Key capabilities_

- **Configuration and vulnerability scanning:** Kubescape analyzes Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, and live clusters for misconfigurations and known vulnerabilities, helping teams identify and remediate issues early and continuously.
- **Policy and compliance enforcement:** The platform supports multiple security frameworks (including CIS Benchmarks, NSA-CISA, MITRE ATT&CK, SOC 2, and more), enabling teams to validate their clusters and workloads against industry standards and custom policies.
- **Network policy and seccomp validation:** Kubescape checks for the presence and correctness of network policies and seccomp profiles, helping to enforce least-privilege and reduce attack surface.
- **Runtime detection:** Beyond static analysis, Kubescape provides runtime monitoring and detection for suspicious activity and threats in active clusters.
- **Developer and CI/CD integration:** Kubescape integrates with popular IDEs (such as VSCode and Lens) and CI/CD systems (like GitHub Actions and GitLab CI), making it easy to include security checks in development workflows.
- **Multi-cloud and distribution support:** Kubescape works across major cloud providers and Kubernetes distributions, supporting a wide range of deployment scenarios.

By combining these features in a single open-source project, Kubescape aims to make robust Kubernetes security accessible and practical for engineering teams, from configuration to runtime.

Kubescape was created by [ARMO](https://www.armosec.io/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository) and is a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) incubating project](https://www.cncf.io/projects/kubescape/).

_Please [star ‚≠ê](https://github.com/kubescape/kubescape/stargazers) the repo if you want us to continue developing and improving Kubescape! üòÄ_

## Getting started

Experimenting with Kubescape is as easy as:

``` sh
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubescape/kubescape/master/install.sh | /bin/bash
```

Learn more about:

* [Installing Kubescape](https://github.com/kubescape/kubescape/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md#install-kubescape)
* [Running your first scan](https://github.com/kubescape/kubescape/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md#run-your-first-scan)
* [Usage](https://github.com/kubescape/kubescape/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md#examples)
* [Architecture](https://github.com/kubescape/kubescape/blob/master/docs/architecture.md)
* [Building Kubescape from source](https://github.com/kubescape/kubescape/blob/master/docs/building.md)

_Did you know you can use Kubescape in all these places?_

</div>

## Under the hood

Kubescape uses [Open Policy Agent](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa) to verify Kubernetes objects against [a library of posture controls](https://github.com/kubescape/regolibrary).
For image scanning, it uses [Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype).
For image patching, it uses [Copacetic](https://github.com/project-copacetic/copacetic).
For eBPF, it uses [Inspektor Gadet](https://github.com/inspektor-gadget)

By default, the results are printed in a console-friendly manner, but they can be:

* exported to JSON or junit XML
* rendered to HTML or PDF
* submitted to a [cloud service](https://github.com/kubescape/kubescape/blob/master/docs/providers.md)

It retrieves Kubernetes objects from the API server and runs a set of [Rego snippets](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/) developed by [ARMO](https://www.armosec.io/?utm_source=kubescape.io&utm_medium=website).
