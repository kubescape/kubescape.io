## Severity

Medium

## Description of the the issue

Users with rights to create/modify/delete validatingwebhookconfigurations or mutatingwebhookconfigurations can control webhooks that can read any object admitted to the cluster, and in the case of mutating webhooks, also mutate admitted objects. This could allow for privilege escalation or disruption of the operation of the cluster.

## What does this control test

Check which subjects have RBAC permissions to create/modify/delete validatingwebhookconfigurations or mutatingwebhookconfigurations objects.

## How to check it manually

Review the users who have access to validatingwebhookconfigurations or mutatingwebhookconfigurations objects in the Kubernetes API.

## Remediation

Where possible, remove access to the validatingwebhookconfigurations or mutatingwebhookconfigurations objects

### Impact Statement

Users with rights to create/modify/delete validatingwebhookconfigurations or mutatingwebhookconfigurations can control webhooks that can read any object admitted to the cluster, and in the case of mutating webhooks, also mutate admitted objects. This could allow for privilege escalation or disruption of the operation of the cluster.

### Default Value

By default in a kubeadm cluster the following list of principals have `create/modify/delete` privileges on `validatingwebhookconfigurations/mutatingwebhookconfigurations` objects `CLUSTERROLEBINDING                                    SUBJECT                             TYPE            SA-NAMESPACEcluster-admin                                         system:masters                      Group           system:controller:clusterrole-aggregation-controller  clusterrole-aggregation-controller  ServiceAccount  kube-systemsystem:controller:daemon-set-controller               daemon-set-controller               ServiceAccount  kube-systemsystem:controller:job-controller                      job-controller                      ServiceAccount  kube-systemsystem:controller:persistent-volume-binder            persistent-volume-binder            ServiceAccount  kube-systemsystem:controller:replicaset-controller               replicaset-controller               ServiceAccount  kube-systemsystem:controller:replication-controller              replication-controller              ServiceAccount  kube-systemsystem:controller:statefulset-controller              statefulset-controller              ServiceAccount  kube-system`
