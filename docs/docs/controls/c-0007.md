apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: pod-exec
rules:
- apiGroups: ["*"]
  resources: ["secrets","pods","services","depolyments","replicasets","deamonsets","stateflsets","jobs,"cronjobs"]  # we look for one of these resources or *
  verbs: ["delete","deletecollection"]	    # we look for one of these verbs or *
