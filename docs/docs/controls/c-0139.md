## Severity

High

## Description of the the issue

API server communication contains sensitive parameters that should remain encrypted in transit. Configure the API server to serve only HTTPS traffic. If `--client-ca-file` argument is set, any request presenting a client certificate signed by one of the authorities in the `client-ca-file` is authenticated with an identity corresponding to the CommonName of the client certificate.

## Related resources

Pod

## What does this control test

Setup TLS connection on the API server.

## How to check it manually

Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

```
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver

```

 Verify that the `--client-ca-file` argument exists and it is set as appropriate.

## Remediation

Follow the Kubernetes documentation and set up the TLS connection on the apiserver. Then, edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the master node and set the client certificate authority file.

```
--client-ca-file=<path/to/client-ca-file>

```

### Impact Statement

TLS and client certificate authentication must be configured for your Kubernetes cluster deployment.

### Default Value

By default, `--client-ca-file` argument is not set.

## Example

No example
