## Severity

Medium

## Description of the the issue

Mounting Docker socket (Unix socket) enables container to access Docker internals, retrieve sensitive information and execute Docker commands, if Docker runtime is available. This control identifies pods that attempt to mount Docker socket for accessing Docker runtime.

## What does this control test

Check hostpath. If the path is set to one of the container runtime socket, the container has access to container runtime - fail.

## Remediation

Remove container runtime socket mount request or define an exception.

## Example

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-with-hostpath-mounting
spec:
  containers:
  - name: test-webserver
    image: k8s.gcr.io/test-webserver:latest
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /var/local/aaa
      name: mydir
    - mountPath: /var/local/aaa/1.txt
      name: myfile
  volumes:
  - name: mydir
    hostPath:
      # Ensure the file directory is created.
      path: /var/run/docker
      type: DirectoryOrCreate
  - name: myfile
    hostPath:
      path: /var/run/docker.sock
      type: FileOrCreate

```
