## Severity

High

## Description of the the issue

etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should be encrypted in transit.

## Related resources

Pod

## What does this control test

Configure TLS encryption for the etcd service.

## How to check it manually

Run the following command on the etcd server node

```
ps -ef | grep etcd

```

 Verify that the `--cert-file` and the `--key-file` arguments are set as appropriate.

## Remediation

Follow the etcd service documentation and configure TLS encryption.

 Then, edit the etcd pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` on the master node and set the below parameters.

```
--cert-file=</path/to/ca-file>
--key-file=</path/to/key-file>

```

### Impact Statement

Client connections only over TLS would be served.

### Default Value

By default, TLS encryption is not set.

## Example

No example
