## Severity

Medium

## Description of the the issue

SecurityContextDeny can be used to provide a layer of security for clusters which do not have PodSecurityPolicies enabled.

## Related resources

Pod

## What does this control test

The SecurityContextDeny admission controller can be used to deny pods which make use of some SecurityContext fields which could allow for privilege escalation in the cluster. This should be used where PodSecurityPolicy is not in place within the cluster.

## How to check it manually

Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

```
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver

```

 Verify that the `--enable-admission-plugins` argument is set to a value that includes `SecurityContextDeny`, if `PodSecurityPolicy` is not included.

## Remediation

Edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the Control Plane node and set the `--enable-admission-plugins` parameter to include `SecurityContextDeny`, unless `PodSecurityPolicy` is already in place.

```
--enable-admission-plugins=...,SecurityContextDeny,...

```

### Impact Statement

This admission controller should only be used where Pod Security Policies cannot be used on the cluster, as it can interact poorly with certain Pod Security Policies

### Default Value

By default, `SecurityContextDeny` is not set.

## Example

No example
