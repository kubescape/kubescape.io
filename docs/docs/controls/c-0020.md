# C-0020 - Mount service principal

_Integrate with cloud providers (see [here](../../../integrations/kubescape-integration-with-cloud-providers/))_

## Framework

AllControls, MITRE

## Severity

Medium

## Description of the the issue

When the cluster is deployed in the cloud, in some cases attackers can leverage their access to a container in the cluster to gain cloud credentials. For example, in AKS each node contains service principal credential.

## Related resources

CronJob, DaemonSet, Deployment, Job, Pod, ReplicaSet, StatefulSet

## What does this control test

Check which workloads have volumes with potential access to known cloud credentials folders or files in node, like “/etc/kubernetes/azure.json” for Azure.

## Remediation

Refrain from using path mount to known cloud credentials folders or files .

## Example

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: test-pd
spec:
  containers:
  - image: k8s.gcr.io/test-webserver
    name: test-container
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /test-pd
      name: test-volume
  volumes:
  - name: test-volume
    hostPath: # This field triggers failure!
      path: /data
      type: Directory

```
