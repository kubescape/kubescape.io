## Remediation

Use Kubernetes secrets or Key Management Systems to store credentials.

## Configuration

This control can be configured using the following parameters. Read CLI/UI documentation about how to change parameters.

### Sensitive Values

[sensitiveValues](../frameworks-and-controls/configuration-parameters.md#sensitivevalues)  
Strings that identify a value that Kubescape believes should be stored in a Secret, and not in a ConfigMap or an environment variable.

### Allowed Values

[sensitiveValuesAllowed](../frameworks-and-controls/configuration-parameters.md#sensitivevaluesallowed)  
Reduce false positives with known values.

### Sensitive Keys

[sensitiveKeyNames](../frameworks-and-controls/configuration-parameters.md#sensitivekeynames)  
Key names that identify a potential value that should be stored in a Secret, and not in a ConfigMap or an environment variable.

### Allowed Keys

[sensitiveKeyNamesAllowed](../frameworks-and-controls/configuration-parameters.md#sensitivekeynamesallowed)  
Reduce false positives with known key names.
