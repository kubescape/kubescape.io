## Severity

Medium

## Description of the the issue

Containers may run as any Linux user. Containers which run as the root user, whilst constrained by Container Runtime security features still have a escalated likelihood of container breakout.

 Ideally, all containers should run as a defined non-UID 0 user.

 There should be at least one PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) defined which does not permit root users in a container.

 If you need to run root containers, this should be defined in a separate PSP and you should carefully check RBAC controls to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to access that PSP.

## What does this control test

Do not generally permit containers to be run as the root user.

## How to check it manually

Get the set of PSPs with the following command:

```
kubectl get psp

```

 For each PSP, check whether running containers as root is enabled:

```
kubectl get psp <name> -o=jsonpath='{.spec.runAsUser.rule}'

```

 Verify that there is at least one PSP which returns `MustRunAsNonRoot` or `MustRunAs` with the range of UIDs not including 0.

## Remediation

Create a PSP as described in the Kubernetes documentation, ensuring that the `.spec.runAsUser.rule` is set to either `MustRunAsNonRoot` or `MustRunAs` with the range of UIDs not including 0.

### Impact Statement

Pods with containers which run as the root user will not be permitted.

### Default Value

By default, PodSecurityPolicies are not defined.

## Example
