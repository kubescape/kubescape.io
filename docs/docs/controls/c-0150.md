cis-v1.23-t1.0.1, cis-v1.10.0

## Severity

Medium

## Description of the the issue

The Controller Manager API service which runs on port 10252/TCP by default is used for health and metrics information and is available without authentication or encryption. As such it should only be bound to a localhost interface, to minimize the cluster's attack surface

## Related resources

Pod

## What does this control test

Do not bind the Controller Manager service to non-loopback insecure addresses.

## How to check it manually

Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

```
ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager

```

 Verify that the `--bind-address` argument is set to 127.0.0.1

## Remediation

Edit the Controller Manager pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml` on the Control Plane node and ensure the correct value for the `--bind-address` parameter

### Impact Statement

None

### Default Value

By default, the `--bind-address` parameter is set to 0.0.0.0

## Example

No example
