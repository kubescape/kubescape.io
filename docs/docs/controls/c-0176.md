_Run Kubescape with host sensor (see [here](../../components/host-sensor))_

## Framework

cis-eks-t1.2.0, cis-aks-t1.2.0, cis-v1.23-t1.0.1, cis-v1.10.0

## Severity

Low

## Description of the the issue

Setting idle timeouts ensures that you are protected against Denial-of-Service attacks, inactive connections and running out of ephemeral ports.

 **Note:** By default, `--streaming-connection-idle-timeout` is set to 4 hours which might be too high for your environment. Setting this as appropriate would additionally ensure that such streaming connections are timed out after serving legitimate use cases.

## Related resources

## What does this control test

Do not disable timeouts on streaming connections.

## How to check it manually

Run the following command on each node:

```
ps -ef | grep kubelet

```

 Verify that the `--streaming-connection-idle-timeout` argument is not set to `0`.

 If the argument is not present, and there is a Kubelet config file specified by `--config`, check that it does not set `streamingConnectionIdleTimeout` to 0.

## Remediation

If using a Kubelet config file, edit the file to set `streamingConnectionIdleTimeout` to a value other than 0.

 If using command line arguments, edit the kubelet service file `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf` on each worker node and set the below parameter in `KUBELET_SYSTEM_PODS_ARGS` variable.

```
--streaming-connection-idle-timeout=5m

```

 Based on your system, restart the `kubelet` service. For example:

```
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart kubelet.service

```

### Impact Statement

Long-lived connections could be interrupted.

### Default Value

By default, `--streaming-connection-idle-timeout` is set to 4 hours.
