## Severity

High

## Description of the the issue

Kubernetes provides a set of default roles where RBAC is used. Some of these roles such as `cluster-admin` provide wide-ranging privileges which should only be applied where absolutely necessary. Roles such as `cluster-admin` allow super-user access to perform any action on any resource. When used in a `ClusterRoleBinding`, it gives full control over every resource in the cluster and in all namespaces. When used in a `RoleBinding`, it gives full control over every resource in the rolebinding's namespace, including the namespace itself.

## What does this control test

Check which subjects have are bound to the cluster-admin role with a clusterrolebinding.

## How to check it manually

Obtain a list of the principals who have access to the `cluster-admin` role by reviewing the `clusterrolebinding` output for each role binding that has access to the `cluster-admin` role.

```
kubectl get clusterrolebindings -o=custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,ROLE:.roleRef.name,SUBJECT:.subjects[*].name

```

 Review each principal listed and ensure that `cluster-admin` privilege is required for it.

## Remediation

Identify all clusterrolebindings to the cluster-admin role. Check if they are used and if they need this role or if they could use a role with fewer privileges.

 Where possible, first bind users to a lower privileged role and then remove the clusterrolebinding to the cluster-admin role :

```
kubectl delete clusterrolebinding [name]

```

### Impact Statement

Care should be taken before removing any `clusterrolebindings` from the environment to ensure they were not required for operation of the cluster. Specifically, modifications should not be made to `clusterrolebindings` with the `system:` prefix as they are required for the operation of system components.

### Default Value

By default a single `clusterrolebinding` called `cluster-admin` is provided with the `system:masters` group as its principal.
