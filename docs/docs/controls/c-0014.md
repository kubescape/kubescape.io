## Severity

Low

## Description of the the issue

The Kubernetes dashboard is a web-based UI that is used for monitoring and managing the Kubernetes cluster. The dashboard allows users to perform actions in the cluster using its service account (Kubernetes-dashboard) with the permissions that are determined by the binding or cluster-binding for this service account. Attackers who gain access to a container in the cluster, can use its network access to the dashboard pod. Consequently, attackers may retrieve information about the various resources in the cluster using the dashboard’s identity.

## What does this control test

Check who is associated with the dashboard service account or bound to dashboard role/clusterrole.

## Remediation

Make sure that the “Kubernetes Dashboard” service account is only bound to the Kubernetes dashboard following the least privilege principle.
