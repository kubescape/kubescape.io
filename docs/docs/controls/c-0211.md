## Severity

High

## Description of the the issue

A security context defines the operating system security settings (uid, gid, capabilities, SELinux role, etc..) applied to a container. When designing your containers and pods, make sure that you configure the security context for your pods, containers, and volumes. A security context is a property defined in the deployment yaml. It controls the security parameters that will be assigned to the pod/container/volume. There are two levels of security context: pod level security context, and container level security context.

## What does this control test

Check that pod and container security context fields according to recommendations in CIS Security Benchmark for Docker Containers

## How to check it manually

Review the pod definitions in your cluster and verify that you have security contexts defined as appropriate.

## Remediation

Follow the Kubernetes documentation and apply security contexts to your pods. For a suggested list of security contexts, you may refer to the CIS Security Benchmark for Docker Containers.

### Impact Statement

If you incorrectly apply security contexts, you may have trouble running the pods.

### Default Value

By default, no security contexts are automatically applied to pods.

## Example

No example
