## Severity

High

## Description of the the issue

The token-based authentication utilizes static tokens to authenticate requests to the apiserver. The tokens are stored in clear-text in a file on the apiserver, and cannot be revoked or rotated without restarting the apiserver. Hence, do not use static token-based authentication.

Pod

## What does this control test

Do not use token based authentication.

## How to check it manually

Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

```
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver

```

 Verify that the `--token-auth-file` argument does not exist.

## Remediation

Follow the documentation and configure alternate mechanisms for authentication. Then, edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the master node and remove the `--token-auth-file=<filename>` parameter.

### Impact Statement

You will have to configure and use alternate authentication mechanisms such as certificates. Static token based authentication could not be used.

### Default Value

By default, `--token-auth-file` argument is not set.

## Example

No example
