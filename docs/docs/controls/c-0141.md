# C-0141 - Ensure that the API Server --encryption-provider-config argument is set as appropriate

[‚Üê Back to all controls](index.md)


_Run Kubescape with host sensor (see [here](../../components/host-sensor))_

## Framework

cis-v1.23-t1.0.1, cis-v1.10.0

## Severity

High

## Description of the the issue

etcd is a highly available key-value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should be encrypted at rest to avoid any disclosures.

## Related resources

Pod

## What does this control test

Encrypt etcd key-value store.

## How to check it manually

Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

```
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver

```

 Verify that the `--encryption-provider-config` argument is set to a `EncryptionConfig` file. Additionally, ensure that the `EncryptionConfig` file has all the desired `resources` covered especially any secrets.

## Remediation

Follow the Kubernetes documentation and configure a `EncryptionConfig` file. Then, edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the master node and set the `--encryption-provider-config` parameter to the path of that file:

```
--encryption-provider-config=</path/to/EncryptionConfig/File>

```

### Impact Statement

None

### Default Value

By default, `--encryption-provider-config` is not set.

## Example

No example
