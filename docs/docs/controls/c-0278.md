## Severity

Medium

## Description of the the issue

The ability to create persistent volumes in a cluster can provide an opportunity for privilege escalation, via the creation of hostPath volumes. As persistent volumes are not covered by Pod Security Admission, a user with access to create persistent volumes may be able to get access to sensitive files from the underlying host even where restrictive Pod Security Admission policies are in place.

## What does this control test

Check which subjects have RBAC permissions to create persistentvolumes.

## How to check it manually

Review the users who have create access to persistentvolume objects in the Kubernetes API.

## Remediation

Where possible, remove `create` access to `persistentvolume` objects in the cluster.

### Impact Statement

Care should be taken not to remove access to pods to system components which require this for their operation

### Default Value

By default in a kubeadm cluster the following list of principals have `create` privileges on `persistentvolume` objects `CLUSTERROLEBINDING                                    SUBJECT                             TYPE            SA-NAMESPACEcluster-admin                                         system:masters                      Group           system:controller:clusterrole-aggregation-controller  clusterrole-aggregation-controller  ServiceAccount  kube-systemsystem:controller:daemon-set-controller               daemon-set-controller               ServiceAccount  kube-systemsystem:controller:job-controller                      job-controller                      ServiceAccount  kube-systemsystem:controller:persistent-volume-binder            persistent-volume-binder            ServiceAccount  kube-systemsystem:controller:replicaset-controller               replicaset-controller               ServiceAccount  kube-systemsystem:controller:replication-controller              replication-controller              ServiceAccount  kube-systemsystem:controller:statefulset-controller              statefulset-controller              ServiceAccount  kube-system`
