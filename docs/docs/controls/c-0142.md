_Run Kubescape with host sensor (see [here](../../components/host-sensor))_

## Framework

cis-v1.23-t1.0.1, cis-v1.10.0

## Severity

High

## Description of the the issue

Where `etcd` encryption is used, it is important to ensure that the appropriate set of encryption providers is used. Currently, the `aescbc`, `kms` and `secretbox` are likely to be appropriate options.

## Related resources

## What does this control test

Where `etcd` encryption is used, appropriate providers should be configured.

## How to check it manually

Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

```
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver

```

 Get the `EncryptionConfig` file set for `--encryption-provider-config` argument. Verify that `aescbc`, `kms` or `secretbox` is set as the encryption provider for all the desired `resources`.

## Remediation

Follow the Kubernetes documentation and configure a `EncryptionConfig` file. In this file, choose `aescbc`, `kms` or `secretbox` as the encryption provider.

### Impact Statement

None

### Default Value

By default, no encryption provider is set.

## Example

No example
