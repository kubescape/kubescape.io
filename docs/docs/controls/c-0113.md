## Severity

High

## Description of the the issue

When enabled, requests that are not rejected by other configured authentication methods are treated as anonymous requests. These requests are then served by the API server. You should rely on authentication to authorize access and disallow anonymous requests.

 If you are using RBAC authorization, it is generally considered reasonable to allow anonymous access to the API Server for health checks and discovery purposes, and hence this recommendation is not scored. However, you should consider whether anonymous discovery is an acceptable risk for your purposes.

## What does this control test

Disable anonymous requests to the API server.

## How to check it manually

Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

```
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver

```

 Verify that the `--anonymous-auth` argument is set to `false`.

## Remediation

Edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the Control Plane node and set the below parameter.

```
--anonymous-auth=false

```

### Impact Statement

Anonymous requests will be rejected.

### Default Value

By default, anonymous access is enabled.

## Example

No example
