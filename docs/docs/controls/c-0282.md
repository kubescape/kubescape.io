## Severity

Medium

## Description of the the issue

Users with rights to create new service account tokens at a cluster level, can create long-lived privileged credentials in the cluster. This could allow for privilege escalation and persistent access to the cluster, even if the users account has been revoked.

## Related resources

ClusterRole, ClusterRoleBinding, Role, RoleBinding

## What does this control test

Check which subjects have RBAC permissions to create the token sub-resource of serviceaccount objects.

## How to check it manually

Review the users who have access to create the token sub-resource of serviceaccount objects in the Kubernetes API.

## Remediation

Where possible, remove access to the token sub-resource of serviceaccount objects.

### Impact Statement

Users with rights to create new service account tokens at a cluster level, can create long-lived privileged credentials in the cluster. This could allow for privilege escalation and persistent access to the cluster, even if the users account has been revoked.

### Default Value

By default in a kubeadm cluster the following list of principals have `create` privileges on `serviceaccount/token` objects `CLUSTERROLEBINDING                                    SUBJECT                             TYPE            SA-NAMESPACEcluster-admin                                         system:masters                      Group           system:controller:clusterrole-aggregation-controller  clusterrole-aggregation-controller  ServiceAccount  kube-systemsystem:controller:daemon-set-controller               daemon-set-controller               ServiceAccount  kube-systemsystem:controller:job-controller                      job-controller                      ServiceAccount  kube-systemsystem:controller:persistent-volume-binder            persistent-volume-binder            ServiceAccount  kube-systemsystem:controller:replicaset-controller               replicaset-controller               ServiceAccount  kube-systemsystem:controller:replication-controller              replication-controller              ServiceAccount  kube-systemsystem:controller:statefulset-controller              statefulset-controller              ServiceAccount  kube-system`
