_Run Kubescape with host sensor (see [here](../../components/host-sensor))_

## Framework

AllControls, MITRE, ArmoBest, NSA, security

## Severity

Critical

## Description of the the issue

By default, requests to the kubelet's HTTPS endpoint that are not rejected by other configured authentication methods are treated as anonymous requests, and given a username of system:anonymous and a group of system:unauthenticated.

## Related resources

## What does this control test

Reading the kubelet command lines and configuration file looking for anonymous-auth configuration. If this configuration is set on both, the command line values take precedence over it.

## Remediation

Start the kubelet with the --anonymous-auth=false flag.

## Example

No example
