# C-0174 - Ensure that the --client-ca-file argument is set as appropriate

_Run Kubescape with host sensor (see [here](../../components/host-sensor))_

## Framework

cis-eks-t1.2.0, cis-aks-t1.2.0, cis-v1.23-t1.0.1, cis-v1.10.0

## Severity

Medium

## Description of the the issue

The connections from the apiserver to the kubelet are used for fetching logs for pods, attaching (through kubectl) to running pods, and using the kubelet’s port-forwarding functionality. These connections terminate at the kubelet’s HTTPS endpoint. By default, the apiserver does not verify the kubelet’s serving certificate, which makes the connection subject to man-in-the-middle attacks, and unsafe to run over untrusted and/or public networks. Enabling Kubelet certificate authentication ensures that the apiserver could authenticate the Kubelet before submitting any requests.

## What does this control test

Enable Kubelet authentication using certificates.

## How to check it manually

Run the following command on each node:

```
ps -ef | grep kubelet

```

 Verify that the `--client-ca-file` argument exists and is set to the location of the client certificate authority file.

 If the `--client-ca-file` argument is not present, check that there is a Kubelet config file specified by `--config`, and that the file sets `authentication: x509: clientCAFile` to the location of the client certificate authority file.

## Remediation

If using a Kubelet config file, edit the file to set `authentication: x509: clientCAFile` to the location of the client CA file.

 If using command line arguments, edit the kubelet service file `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf` on each worker node and set the below parameter in `KUBELET_AUTHZ_ARGS` variable.

```
--client-ca-file=<path/to/client-ca-file>

```

 Based on your system, restart the `kubelet` service. For example:

```
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart kubelet.service

```

### Impact Statement

You require TLS to be configured on apiserver as well as kubelets.

### Default Value

By default, `--client-ca-file` argument is not set.

## Example

No example
