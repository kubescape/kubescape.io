## Severity

High

## Description of the the issue

The principle of least privilege recommends that users are provided only the access required for their role and nothing more. The use of wildcard rights grants is likely to provide excessive rights to the Kubernetes API.

## What does this control test

Check which subjects have wildcard RBAC permissions.

## How to check it manually

Retrieve the roles defined across each namespaces in the cluster and review for wildcards

```
kubectl get roles --all-namespaces -o yaml

```

 Retrieve the cluster roles defined in the cluster and review for wildcards

```
kubectl get clusterroles -o yaml

```
