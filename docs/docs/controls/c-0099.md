_Run Kubescape with host sensor (see [here](../../components/host-sensor))_

## Framework

cis-v1.23-t1.0.1, cis-v1.10.0

## Severity

Medium

## Description of the the issue

The etcd pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` controls various parameters that set the behavior of the `etcd` service in the master node. etcd is a highly-available key-value store which Kubernetes uses for persistent storage of all of its REST API object. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by `root:root`.

## What does this control test

Ensure that the `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` file ownership is set to `root:root`.

## How to check it manually

Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. For example,

```
stat -c %U:%G /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml

```

 Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.

## Remediation

Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. For example,

```
chown root:root /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml

```

### Impact Statement

None

### Default Value

By default, `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` file ownership is set to `root:root`.

## Example

No example
