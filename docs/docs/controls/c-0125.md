## Severity

Low

## Description of the the issue

When you create a pod, if you do not specify a service account, it is automatically assigned the `default` service account in the same namespace. You should create your own service account and let the API server manage its security tokens.

## Related resources

Pod

## What does this control test

Automate service accounts management.

## How to check it manually

Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

```
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver

```

 Verify that the `--disable-admission-plugins` argument is set to a value that does not includes `ServiceAccount`.

## Remediation

Follow the documentation and create `ServiceAccount` objects as per your environment. Then, edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the master node and ensure that the `--disable-admission-plugins` parameter is set to a value that does not include `ServiceAccount`.

### Impact Statement

None.

### Default Value

By default, `ServiceAccount` is set.

## Example

No example
