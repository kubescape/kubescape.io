## Severity

High

## Description of the the issue

etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should be protected by client authentication. This requires the API server to identify itself to the etcd server using a SSL Certificate Authority file.

## Related resources

Pod

## What does this control test

etcd should be configured to make use of TLS encryption for client connections.

## How to check it manually

Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

```
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver

```

 Verify that the `--etcd-cafile` argument exists and it is set as appropriate.

## Remediation

Follow the Kubernetes documentation and set up the TLS connection between the apiserver and etcd. Then, edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the master node and set the etcd certificate authority file parameter.

```
--etcd-cafile=<path/to/ca-file>

```

### Impact Statement

TLS and client certificate authentication must be configured for etcd.

### Default Value

By default, `--etcd-cafile` is not set.

## Example

No example
