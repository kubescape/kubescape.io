## Severity

Medium

## Description of the the issue

Limiting the scope of user permissions can reduce the impact of mistakes or malicious activities. A Kubernetes namespace allows you to partition created resources into logically named groups. Resources created in one namespace can be hidden from other namespaces. By default, each resource created by a user in Kubernetes cluster runs in a default namespace, called `default`. You can create additional namespaces and attach resources and users to them. You can use Kubernetes Authorization plugins to create policies that segregate access to namespace resources between different users.

## What does this control test

Lists all namespaces in cluster for user to review

## How to check it manually

Run the below command and review the namespaces created in the cluster.

```
kubectl get namespaces

```

 Ensure that these namespaces are the ones you need and are adequately administered as per your requirements.

## Remediation

Follow the documentation and create namespaces for objects in your deployment as you need them.

### Impact Statement

You need to switch between namespaces for administration.

### Default Value

By default, Kubernetes starts with two initial namespaces: 1. `default` - The default namespace for objects with no other namespace2. `kube-system` - The namespace for objects created by the Kubernetes system3. `kube-node-lease` - Namespace used for node heartbeats4. `kube-public` - Namespace used for public information in a cluster
