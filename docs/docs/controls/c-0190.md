## Severity

Medium

## Description of the the issue

Mounting service account tokens inside pods can provide an avenue for privilege escalation attacks where an attacker is able to compromise a single pod in the cluster.

 Avoiding mounting these tokens removes this attack avenue.

## What does this control test

Check that all service accounts and workloads disable automount of service account tokens.

## How to check it manually

Review pod and service account objects in the cluster and ensure that the option below is set, unless the resource explicitly requires this access.

```
automountServiceAccountToken: false

```

## Remediation

Modify the definition of pods and service accounts which do not need to mount service account tokens to disable it.

### Impact Statement

Pods mounted without service account tokens will not be able to communicate with the API server, except where the resource is available to unauthenticated principals.

### Default Value

By default, all pods get a service account token mounted in them.

## Example

No example
