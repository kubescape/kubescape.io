## Description of the the issue

Kubernetes makes use of a number of certificate files as part of the operation of its components. The permissions on these files should be set to `600` or more restrictive to protect their integrity.

## What does this control test

Ensure that Kubernetes PKI certificate files have permissions of `600` or more restrictive.

## How to check it manually

Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. For example,

```
ls -laR /etc/kubernetes/pki/*.crt

```

 Verify that the permissions are `600` or more restrictive.

## Remediation

Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. For example,

```
chmod -R 600 /etc/kubernetes/pki/*.crt

```

### Impact Statement

None
