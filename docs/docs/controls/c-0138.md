## Severity

High

## Description of the the issue

API server communication contains sensitive parameters that should remain encrypted in transit. Configure the API server to serve only HTTPS traffic.

## Related resources

Pod

## What does this control test

Setup TLS connection on the API server.

## How to check it manually

Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

```
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver

```

 Verify that the `--tls-cert-file` and `--tls-private-key-file` arguments exist and they are set as appropriate.

## Remediation

Follow the Kubernetes documentation and set up the TLS connection on the apiserver. Then, edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the master node and set the TLS certificate and private key file parameters.

```
--tls-cert-file=<path/to/tls-certificate-file> 
--tls-private-key-file=<path/to/tls-key-file>

```

### Impact Statement

TLS and client certificate authentication must be configured for your Kubernetes cluster deployment.

### Default Value

By default, `--tls-cert-file` and `--tls-private-key-file` arguments are not set.

## Example

No example
