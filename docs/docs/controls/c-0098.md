## Framework

cis-v1.23-t1.0.1, cis-v1.10.0

## Severity

Medium

## Description of the the issue

The etcd pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` controls various parameters that set the behavior of the `etcd` service in the master node. etcd is a highly-available key-value store which Kubernetes uses for persistent storage of all of its REST API object. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.

## What does this control test

Ensure that the `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` file has permissions of `600` or more restrictive.

## How to check it manually

Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. For example,

```
stat -c %a /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml

```

 Verify that the permissions are `600` or more restrictive.

## Remediation

Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. For example,

```
chmod 600 /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml

```

### Impact Statement

None

### Default Value

By default, `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` file has permissions of `640`.
