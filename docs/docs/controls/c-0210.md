## Severity

Medium

## Description of the the issue

Seccomp (secure computing mode) is used to restrict the set of system calls applications can make, allowing cluster administrators greater control over the security of workloads running in the cluster. Kubernetes disables seccomp profiles by default for historical reasons. You should enable it to ensure that the workloads have restricted actions available within the container.

## What does this control test

Checks if seccomp profile is defined as type RuntimeDefault in security context of workload or container level

## How to check it manually

Review the pod definitions in your cluster. It should create a line as below:

```
  securityContext:
    seccompProfile:
      type: RuntimeDefault

```

## Remediation

Use security context to enable the `docker/default` seccomp profile in your pod definitions. An example is as below:

```
  securityContext:
    seccompProfile:
      type: RuntimeDefault

```

### Impact Statement

If the `docker/default` seccomp profile is too restrictive for you, you would have to create/manage your own seccomp profiles.

### Default Value

By default, seccomp profile is set to `unconfined` which means that no seccomp profiles are enabled.

## Example

No example
