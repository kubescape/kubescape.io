## Severity

High

## Description of the the issue

A Windows container making use of the `hostProcess` flag can interact with the underlying Windows cluster node. As per the Kubernetes documentation, this provides "privileged access" to the Windows node.

 Where Windows containers are used inside a Kubernetes cluster, there should be at least one admission control policy which does not permit `hostProcess` Windows containers.

 If you need to run Windows containers which require `hostProcess`, this should be defined in a separate policy and you should carefully check to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to use that policy.

## What does this control test

Do not generally permit Windows containers to be run with the `hostProcess` flag set to true.

## How to check it manually

List the policies in use for each namespace in the cluster, ensure that each policy disallows the admission of `hostProcess` containers

## Remediation

Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the admission of `hostProcess` containers.

### Impact Statement

Pods defined with `securityContext.windowsOptions.hostProcess: true` will not be permitted unless they are run under a specific policy.

### Default Value

By default, there are no restrictions on the creation of `hostProcess` containers.

## Example

No example
