## Severity

Low

## Description of the the issue

By default, containers are permitted mostly unrestricted execution within their own context. An attacker who has access to a container, can create files and download scripts as he wishes, and modify the underlying application running on the container.

## What does this control test

Check whether the readOnlyRootFilesystem field in the SecurityContext is set to true. 

## Remediation

Set the filesystem of the container to read-only when possible (pod securityContext, readOnlyRootFilesystem: true). If containers application needs to write into the filesystem, it is recommended to mount secondary filesystems for specific directories where application require write access.

## Example

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: security-context-demo
spec:
  containers:
  - name: sec-ctx-demo
    image: busybox
    command: [ "sh", "-c", "sleep 1h" ]
    securityContext:
      readOnlyRootFilesystem : true  #we check this is set to true
```
