## Severity

Medium

## Description of the the issue

To ensure that keys for service account tokens can be rotated as needed, a separate public/private key pair should be used for signing service account tokens. The private key should be specified to the controller manager with `--service-account-private-key-file` as appropriate.

Pod

## What does this control test

Explicitly set a service account private key file for service accounts on the controller manager.

## How to check it manually

Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

```
ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager

```

 Verify that the `--service-account-private-key-file` argument is set as appropriate.

## Remediation

Edit the Controller Manager pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml` on the Control Plane node and set the `--service-account-private-key-file` parameter to the private key file for service accounts.

```
--service-account-private-key-file=<filename>

```

### Impact Statement

You would need to securely maintain the key file and rotate the keys based on your organization's key rotation policy.

### Default Value

By default, `--service-account-private-key-file` it not set.

## Example
