# C-0110 - Ensure that the Kubernetes PKI directory and file ownership is set to root:root

_Run Kubescape with host sensor (see [here](../../components/host-sensor))_

## Framework

cis-v1.23-t1.0.1, cis-v1.10.0

## Severity

High

## Description of the the issue

Kubernetes makes use of a number of certificates as part of its operation. You should set the ownership of the directory containing the PKI information and all files in that directory to maintain their integrity. The directory and files should be owned by `root:root`.

## What does this control test

Ensure that the Kubernetes PKI directory and file ownership is set to `root:root`.

## How to check it manually

Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. For example,

```
ls -laR /etc/kubernetes/pki/

```

 Verify that the ownership of all files and directories in this hierarchy is set to `root:root`.

## Remediation

Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node. For example,

```
chown -R root:root /etc/kubernetes/pki/

```

### Impact Statement

None

### Default Value

By default, the /etc/kubernetes/pki/ directory and all of the files and directories contained within it, are set to be owned by the root user.
