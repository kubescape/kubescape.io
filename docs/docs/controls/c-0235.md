_Run Kubescape with host sensor (see [here](../../components/host-sensor))_

## Framework

cis-eks-t1.2.0, cis-aks-t1.2.0

## Severity

Medium

## Description of the the issue

The kubelet reads various parameters, including security settings, from a config file specified by the `--config` argument. If this file is specified you should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.

## What does this control test

Ensure that if the kubelet refers to a configuration file with the `--config` argument, that file has permissions of 644 or more restrictive.

## How to check it manually

First, SSH to the relevant worker node:

 To check to see if the Kubelet Service is running:

```
sudo systemctl status kubelet

```

 The output should return `Active: active (running) since..`

 Run the following command on each node to find the appropriate Kubelet config file:

```
ps -ef | grep kubelet

```

 The output of the above command should return something similar to `--config /etc/kubernetes/kubelet/kubelet-config.json` which is the location of the Kubelet config file.

 Run the following command:

```
stat -c %a /etc/kubernetes/kubelet/kubelet-config.json

```

 The output of the above command is the Kubelet config file's permissions. Verify that the permissions are `644` or more restrictive.

## Remediation

Run the following command (using the config file location identified in the Audit step)

```
chmod 644 /etc/kubernetes/kubelet/kubelet-config.json

```

### Impact Statement

None.

### Default Value

See the AWS EKS documentation for the default value.

## Example
