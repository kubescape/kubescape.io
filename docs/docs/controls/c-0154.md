## Severity

High

## Description of the the issue

etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are sensitive in nature and should not be available to unauthenticated clients. You should enable the client authentication via valid certificates to secure the access to the etcd service.

## What does this control test

Enable client authentication on etcd service.

## How to check it manually

Run the following command on the etcd server node:

```
ps -ef | grep etcd

```

 Verify that the `--client-cert-auth` argument is set to `true`.

## Remediation

Edit the etcd pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` on the master node and set the below parameter.

```
--client-cert-auth="true"

```

### Impact Statement

All clients attempting to access the etcd server will require a valid client certificate.

### Default Value
