_Run Kubescape with host sensor (see [here](../../components/host-sensor))_

## Framework

cis-v1.23-t1.0.1, cis-v1.10.0

## Severity

High

## Description of the the issue

The kubelet reads various parameters, including security settings, from a config file specified by the `--config` argument. If this file is specified you should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.

## What does this control test

Ensure that if the kubelet refers to a configuration file with the `--config` argument, that file has permissions of 600 or more restrictive.

## How to check it manually

Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node. For example,

```
stat -c %a /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml

```

 Verify that the permissions are `600` or more restrictive.

## Remediation

Run the following command (using the config file location identied in the Audit step)

```
chmod 600 /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml

```

### Impact Statement

None

### Default Value

By default, the /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml file as set up by `kubeadm` has permissions of 600.

## Example
