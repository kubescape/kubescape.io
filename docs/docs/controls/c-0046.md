## Description of the the issue

Giving  insecure and unnecessary capabilities for a container can increase the impact of a container compromise.Note, this control is configurable. See below the details.

## Related resources

## What does this control test

Check capabilities given against a configurable blacklist of insecure capabilities (<https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html>). 

## Remediation

Remove all insecure capabilities which are not necessary for the container.

## Configuration

This control can be configured using the following parameters. Read CLI/UI documentation about how to change parameters.

### Insecure capabilities

[insecureCapabilities](../frameworks-and-controls/configuration-parameters.md#insecurecapabilities)  
Kubescape looks for these capabilities in containers, which might lead to attackers getting elevated privileges in your cluster. You can see the full list of possible capabilities at <https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html>.

## Example

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: security-context-demo-4
spec:
  containers:
  - name: sec-ctx-4
    image: gcr.io/google-samples/node-hello:1.0
    securityContext:
      capabilities:
        add: ["NET_ADMIN", "SYS_TIME"] # we look at these capabilities against the configured list in the control settings (settings-> control -> c46)
```
