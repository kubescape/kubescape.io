## Severity

## Description of the the issue
Giving  insecure and unnecessary capabilities for a container can increase the impact of a container compromise. Note, [this control is configurable](##configuration).
 
## Related resources
CronJob, DaemonSet, Deployment, Job, Pod, ReplicaSet, StatefulSet
 
## What this control tests 
Check capabilities given against a configurable blacklist of insecure capabilities (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html). 
 
## Remediation
Remove all insecure capabilities which are not necessary for the container.
 
## Configuration
 This control can be configured using the following parameters. Read CLI/UI documentation about how to change parameters.
 
### Insecure capabilities
[insecureCapabilities](doc:configuration_parameter_insecurecapabilities)
Kubescape looks for these capabilities in containers, which might lead to attackers getting elevated privileges in your cluster. You can see the full list of possible capabilities at https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html.
 
## Example
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: security-context-demo-4
spec:
  containers:
  - name: sec-ctx-4
    image: gcr.io/google-samples/node-hello:1.0
    securityContext:
      capabilities:
        add: ["NET_ADMIN", "SYS_TIME"] # we look at these capabilities against the configured list in the control settings (settings-> control -> c46)
```
