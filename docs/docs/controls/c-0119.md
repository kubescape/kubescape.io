## Severity

Medium

## Description of the the issue

The `Node` authorization mode only allows kubelets to read `Secret`, `ConfigMap`, `PersistentVolume`, and `PersistentVolumeClaim` objects associated with their nodes.

## Related resources

Pod

## What does this control test

Restrict kubelet nodes to reading only objects associated with them.

## How to check it manually

Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

```
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver

```

 Verify that the `--authorization-mode` argument exists and is set to a value to include `Node`.

## Remediation

Edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the Control Plane node and set the `--authorization-mode` parameter to a value that includes `Node`.

```
--authorization-mode=Node,RBAC

```

### Impact Statement

None

### Default Value

By default, `Node` authorization is not enabled.

## Example

No example
