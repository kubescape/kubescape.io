## Severity

Medium

## Description of the the issue

Users with access to the update the approval sub-resource of certificateaigningrequests objects can approve new client certificates for the Kubernetes API effectively allowing them to create new high-privileged user accounts. This can allow for privilege escalation to full cluster administrator, depending on users configured in the cluster

## What does this control test

Check which subjects have RBAC permissions to update the approval sub-resource of certificatesigningrequests objects.

## How to check it manually

Review the users who have access to update the approval sub-resource of certificatesigningrequests objects in the Kubernetes API.

## Remediation

Where possible, remove access to the approval sub-resource of certificatesigningrequests objects.

### Impact Statement

Users with access to the approval sub-resource of certificatesigningrequests objects can approve new client certificates for the Kubernetes API effectively allowing them to create new high-privileged user accounts.

### Default Value

By default in a kubeadm cluster the following list of principals have `update` privileges on `certificatesigningrequests/approval` objects `CLUSTERROLEBINDING                                    SUBJECT                             TYPE            SA-NAMESPACEcluster-admin                                         system:masters                      Group           system:controller:clusterrole-aggregation-controller  clusterrole-aggregation-controller  ServiceAccount  kube-systemsystem:controller:daemon-set-controller               daemon-set-controller               ServiceAccount  kube-systemsystem:controller:job-controller                      job-controller                      ServiceAccount  kube-systemsystem:controller:persistent-volume-binder            persistent-volume-binder            ServiceAccount  kube-systemsystem:controller:replicaset-controller               replicaset-controller               ServiceAccount  kube-systemsystem:controller:replication-controller              replication-controller              ServiceAccount  kube-systemsystem:controller:statefulset-controller              statefulset-controller              ServiceAccount  kube-system`
