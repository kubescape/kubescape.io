# C-0165 - If proxy kubeconfig file exists ensure ownership is set to root:root

_Run Kubescape with host sensor (see [here](../../components/host-sensor))_

## Framework

cis-v1.23-t1.0.1, cis-v1.10.0

## Severity

Medium

## Description of the the issue

The kubeconfig file for `kube-proxy` controls various parameters for the `kube-proxy` service in the worker node. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by `root:root`.

## Related resources

## What does this control test

If `kube-proxy` is running, ensure that the file ownership of its kubeconfig file is set to `root:root`.

## How to check it manually

Find the kubeconfig file being used by `kube-proxy` by running the following command:

```
ps -ef | grep kube-proxy

```

 If `kube-proxy` is running, get the kubeconfig file location from the `--kubeconfig` parameter.

 To perform the audit:

 Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node. For example,

```
stat -c %U:%G <path><filename>

```

 Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.

## Remediation

Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker node. For example,

```
chown root:root <proxy kubeconfig file>

```

### Impact Statement

None

### Default Value

By default, `proxy` file ownership is set to `root:root`.

## Example

No example
