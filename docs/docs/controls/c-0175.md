_Run Kubescape with host sensor (see [here](../../components/host-sensor))_

## Framework

cis-eks-t1.2.0, cis-aks-t1.2.0, cis-v1.23-t1.0.1, cis-v1.10.0

## Severity

Medium

## Description of the the issue

The Kubelet process provides a read-only API in addition to the main Kubelet API. Unauthenticated access is provided to this read-only API which could possibly retrieve potentially sensitive information about the cluster.

## Related resources

## What does this control test

Disable the read-only port.

## How to check it manually

Run the following command on each node:

```
ps -ef | grep kubelet

```

 Verify that the `--read-only-port` argument exists and is set to `0`.

 If the `--read-only-port` argument is not present, check that there is a Kubelet config file specified by `--config`. Check that if there is a `readOnlyPort` entry in the file, it is set to `0`.

## Remediation

If using a Kubelet config file, edit the file to set `readOnlyPort` to `0`.

 If using command line arguments, edit the kubelet service file `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf` on each worker node and set the below parameter in `KUBELET_SYSTEM_PODS_ARGS` variable.

```
--read-only-port=0

```

 Based on your system, restart the `kubelet` service. For example:

```
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart kubelet.service

```

### Impact Statement

Removal of the read-only port will require that any service which made use of it will need to be re-configured to use the main Kubelet API.

### Default Value

By default, `--read-only-port` is set to `10255/TCP`. However, if a config file is specified by `--config` the default value for `readOnlyPort` is 0.

## Example
