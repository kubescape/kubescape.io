## Severity

High

## Description of the the issue

Role Based Access Control (RBAC) allows fine-grained control over the operations that different entities can perform on different objects in the cluster. It is recommended to use the RBAC authorization mode.

## Related resources

Pod

## What does this control test

Turn on Role Based Access Control.

## How to check it manually

Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

```
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver

```

 Verify that the `--authorization-mode` argument exists and is set to a value to include `RBAC`.

## Remediation

Edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the Control Plane node and set the `--authorization-mode` parameter to a value that includes `RBAC`, for example:

```
--authorization-mode=Node,RBAC

```

### Impact Statement

When RBAC is enabled you will need to ensure that appropriate RBAC settings (including Roles, RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings) are configured to allow appropriate access.

### Default Value

By default, `RBAC` authorization is not enabled.

## Example

No example
