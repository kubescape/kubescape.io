# Vulnerability scanning with the Kubescape operator

The Kubescape operator includes a component which performs vulnerability scanning of all container images that are running in your cluster.  

The **Kubevuln** component scans images which are deployed to the cluster when:

- A new Deployment, StatefulSet, DaemonSet or naked Pod is created
- The container image tag in an existing Deployment, StatefulSet, DaemonSet or Pod is changed

It uses the [Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype) engine to evaluate against a [database of known vulnerabilities](https://github.com/anchore/grype#grypes-database) from a variety of publicly available vulnerability data sources.  The sources include the security announcement data from all major Linux distributions, the [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds), and [GitHub security advisories](https://github.com/advisories).

The results are made available in API objects exposed by the [Kubescape storage engine](index.md#in-cluster-storage).

## Vulnerabilty summaries

For each running container, a `VulnerabilityManifestSummary` object will be created in the namespace.  These are named for the method that the container is deployed.

!!! note "Why do you need more than one object per container?"
    Kubescape's relevancy features consider usage of a container as part of its vulnerability profile.  If code is not run during the inspection period, a component may be filtered from the vulnerabilty list. This means that the SBOM and number of relevant vulnerabilities for a container can vary depending on how it is deployed. [Read more about vulnerability relevancy.](relevancy.md)

Here is an example `VulnerabilityManifestSummary`.  You will see that the relevancy feature is not enabled, and a link to the full vulnerability manifest is provided.

## Vulnerabilty manifests

The `VulnerabilityManifest` contains the full output of the vulnerability scanner, and lets you identify which vulnerabilities were detected in which files.

## Relevancy filtering

Kubescape can examine the use of containers at runtime to suggest which vulnerabilities are most relevant. [Learn about the relevancy feature.](relevancy.md)

## Uploading scan results to a provider

If you have Kubescape configured to use a [provider](../providers.md), then upon the completion of a scan, Kubevuln will send the results to that provider.

## Configuration

### Scanning images pulled from private registries

There are two ways Kubescape vulnerability scanner can access private registries.

* Using `imagePullSecrets` bound to the workload that uses the images
* Granting credentials directly to Kubescape vulnerability scanner to access private registries

#### Using imagePullSecrets

The advantage of this method that it works "out of the box" without any need for the user to add any extra configuration *in case this field is in use* ðŸŽ‰

The disadvantage is that it doesn't work when the private registry is not accessed using `imagePullSecrets` but via direct grant to the Kubelet (example, granting IAM role to access ECR to the EC2 nodes and similar) or when using the registry scan feature, which obviously lacks `imagePullSecrets` field. In these cases, the following method is advised.

#### Granting credentials directly

To scan images that are pulled from private registries without `imagePullSecret`, you can define a Secret with credentials.

!!! note Note
    The secret must start with the name `kubescape-registry-scan`.

For example:

```yaml
kind: Secret
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: kubescape-registry-scan-my-acr-secret
  namespace: kubescape
type: Opaque
stringData:
  registriesAuth: |
    [     
      {
        "registry": "myrepo.azurecr.io",
        "username": "<username/clientID>",
        "password": "<password/secret>",
        "auth_method": "credentials"
      }
    ]
```

For example, in case of a cloud vendor container registry (ECR, ACR or else) the `username` is the "client ID" and the `password` is the "secret".

Kubescape automatically detects these secrets and uses them to access the registries defined under the `registry` field.

#### Insecure registries access

Additional options can be specified in the credentials secret mentioned above for insecure registries access, such as skipping TLS certificate verification or using HTTP instead of HTTPS.

- `skipTLSVerify`: Set to `true` to skip TLS certificate verification.

- `http`: Set to `true` for registry access via HTTP instead of HTTPS.

??? Example

    ```yaml
    kind: Secret
    apiVersion: v1
    metadata:
      name: kubescape-registry-scan-insecure-registry-secret
      namespace: kubescape
    type: Opaque
    stringData:
      registriesAuth: |
        [     
          {
            "registry": "registry.example.io",
            "username": "<username/clientID>",
            "password": "<password/secret>",
            "auth_method": "credentials",
            "skipTLSVerify": true,
            "http": true
          }
        ]
    ```


### Air-gapped installation support

It is possible to get image vulnerability results in an air-gapped mode, where you don't have access to download the Grype database. 

When installing the Helm chart, add the following flag: `--set grypeOfflineDB.enabled=true`

### Recurring image vulnerability scanning

The scanner is triggered by a `CronJob` called `kubevuln-scheduler`. By default, the scanner is triggered daily at midnight:

```
kubevulnScheduler.scanSchedule="0 0 * * *"` 
```

To customize the scan frequency, use `--set kubevulnScheduler.scanSchedule` when installing the Helm chart.
