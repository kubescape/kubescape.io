# Connecting to providers

A provider is a service which sends and receives data from Kubescape.  To configure a provider with Kubescape, you must provide its server URL and your account ID on that service.

With a configured provider, you can download artifacts (custom frameworks, controls, attack tracks and configurations), and upload scan results.

## Configuring a provider

### In the Kubescape client

You can save configuration data for providers with `kubescape config`:

```sh
kubescape config set server <server URL>
kubescape config set accountID <accountID>
```

You can override this configuration wtih `--account <accountID>` and `--server <server>` on the command line.

### In the Kubescape Operator

When installing the operator, specify your account and server as Helm values using  `--set account=<accountID>` and `--set server=<server URL>`.
